Hi <%= AppConfig.app_name -%> admins!

Today is <%= Date.today.strftime("%A %d %B %Y") -%>.

<%- if @can_send -%>
You'll be pleased to know that the daily email for <%= Date.today -%> can be sent and should be sent. Off you go!

<%- else -%>
There's a problem. A daily email needs to be sent but something about the 
system means it can't be sent:

  <%- if Campaign.running.count < 3 -%>
My neural net processor detects <%= pluralize(Campaign.running.count, "campaign") -%> running but there should be 3.

  <%- end -%>
  <%- if @ended_campaigns_need_reporting.count > 0 -%>
Please rectify the <%= pluralize(@ended_campaigns_need_reporting.count, "campaign") -%> without a winning photo.

  <%- end -%>
<%- end -%>
<%= admin_root_url %>

Yours in eternal servitude,
