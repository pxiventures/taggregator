Hi <%= AppConfig.app_name -%> admins!

There's a bit of a problem: I just requested URL <%= @url %>, and the rate limit remaining was <%= @rate_limit_remaining %>.

This might be our global rate limit or a user's. You should be able to tell based on the URL: if it just has a client_id it is our rate limit.

Good luck!

Yours in eternal servitude,
